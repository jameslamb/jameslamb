### oh hey! ðŸ‘‹

I'm James, a data scientist / engineer from Chicago. My time on GitHub is mostly spent writing Python, R, and disgusting shell scripts on projects for data scientists and data engineers. My time off GitHub is spent at hip hop shows and watching reality TV.

#### :shipit: open source stuff I'm maintaining

* [doppel-cli](https://github.com/jameslamb/doppel-cli): a command-line tool for checking if an R and Python library have the same interface
* [LightGBM](https://github.com/microsoft/LightGBM): a lightweight gradient boosting machine
* [pkgnet](https://github.com/uptake/pkgnet): R package for analyzing an R package's dependencies
* [prefect-saturn](https://github.com/saturncloud/prefect-saturn): Python client for runing [Prefect](https://github.com/PrefectHQ/prefect) flows on a Saturn Cloud Dask cluster
* [uptasticsearch](https://github.com/uptake/uptasticsearch): an R data frame client for Elasticsearch

#### âœ‹ open source stuff I've been making little contributions on

* [prefect](https://github.com/PrefectHQ/prefect): a workflow management thing in Python that plays nicely with Dask
* [xgboost](https://github.com/dmlc/xgboost): another gradient boosting machine
